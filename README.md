# mousetrackingdecisionmaking

The experiment examines the kinematic profile of a decision-making process. 
This is achieved through the recording of the mouse trajectory pathway. 
In every trial the participants have to answer either a visual or auditory presented question. 
Two answer buttons (yes and no) are presented in the upper-left and right. 
Each question belongs to one of three categories (clear yes question, question with no clear yes or no answer, clear no question).
Task: participants have to press one of the buttons after they have heard or seen the question.
Variables:
DV: x and y screen coordinates of mouse trajectory
UV 1 : presentation form of question (visual or auditory)
UV 2: category of question (1. clear yes question, 2. no clear yes or no question, 3. Clear no question)
